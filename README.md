## Intruction
  This is a test system. The functions of the system include:
1. Construct the STK test scenario: a satellite, a target location and a sensor mounted on the satellite.
2. Visibility analysis: Analyze the time period when the sensor observes the target location in the orbit of the satellite.
3. Data storage: Store stK-generated data to the blockchain network.
4. Simple dynamic observation: change the sensor range based on blockchain command feedback and verify the change through visibility analysis.
